# 🏥 ClinicTrack v1.0

ClinicTrack is a simple yet effective C language project to manage patient information using file handling and structures. This was built as one of my early foundational projects before college started.

- Save patient records in `clinicdata.txt` using file I/O
- Continue with old data or overwrite it

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- File Handling (`fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fgets`)
- Structures (`struct`)

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Compile the code using any C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the prompts to add or view patient data.
4. All data is saved in `clinicdata.txt`.
